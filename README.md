java cFINAL COURSEWORK INSTRUCTIONS [50% of ffnal mark] 
COMP09110 Python for Network Engineers 
This task is designed to test the ability to put into practice the knowledge gained during your 
module. Your task will be to create a simple video game server that supports a multiplayer video 
game play and demonstrate you can set it up on multiple machines, using your local Wi-Fi 
network. 
This task will be performed in teams that are published on Moodle. Any deviations from the 
teams allocated will result in the students receiving a mark of zero. 
The Task 
You should aim to create a simple 2D game in Python (e.g. using TKinter or any other GUI library 
that you have to learn in your own time) that connects to a game server via a local network to 
allow multiplayer mode. The server must also be written by you and in Python. The server and 
the clients must communicate using the Python socket library we covered in class. You must 
choose TCP or UDP, depending on how much data you want to be sending over the network. The 
game in question should be at least as complex as the game demonstrated by the lecturer 
during the session on the 21 November. 
If the task above seems too difficult, you may choose to implement a HTTP game server in 
python for a simple game (e.g. puzzle, quizzes, board/card games, etc). This server should use 
the Python http library to communicate with a GUI that you may choose to write in a language of 
your choice (including HTMLCSSJS). This option will result in a lower ffnal mark. 
In either case, any components of the game that include natural language, must be in English. 
You should check that your project idea is in line with the expected project complexity. Conffrm 
with your lecturer, during one of your sessions. The lecturer will take note of which teams 
conffrmed their ideas. 
Deliverables 
You should zip your source code. In addition, you should provide the detailed instructions for 
how to set everything up so that the teaching team can effectively mark your code (PDF). You 
should also submit, as a separate PDF ffle (one page max) detailing what each student 
contributed and an approximate percentage split of work each team member has done. Please 
note that if somebody did some work on a feature that ended up removed from the ffnal 
product, this should also be counted as a contribution. The deadline for this to be submitted is: 
6 December 2024, 10:30 Wuxi Time 
In addition to the above ffles, you will also be required to demonstrate, in class, that your setup 
works. If you wi代 写COMP09110、Python

using separate computers, connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Your chance to demonstrate 
this will be during the regularly scheduled session on 
6 December 2024, 10:40—12:15 Wuxi Time 
(If necessary, we may have to extend it into the lunch break for all the teams to demonstrate 
their products setup). This demonstration is the demonstration of gameplay only. THERE IS NO 
NEED TO GIVE A PRESENTATION. Should you wish to complete a demonstration at an earlier 
session for this module, you can. 
 Mark Scheme 
The 50 marks for the task are allocated according to the below mark scheme. Please note that 
these are subject to a 5 mark incorrect format deduction should you submit your coursework in 
a format that does not follow these guidelines. 
Additionally, the standard 5 mark late penalty applies for all submissions that are late, but not 
by more than 7 days. Submissions that are late by more than seven days will not be accepted. 
We operate a zero tolerance policy when it comes to plagiarism and academic dishonesty. 
Anybody found in breach of academic standards will receive a mark of zero and be referred to 
the student affairs office who may take further disciplinary action, up to and including 
expulsion.
